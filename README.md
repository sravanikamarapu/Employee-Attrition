# Employee-Attrition

Employee Attrition refers to the departure of employees from an organization for any reason, including resignation, termination, death, or retirement. It is a major challenge faced by companies of all sizes and industries, as it can lead to decreased productivity, increased costs, and loss of valuable talent and knowledge.

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify employees who are at risk of leaving the company, based on various factors such as their job role, salary, work environment, and personal characteristics. 
To achieve this, we have been provided with a training dataset (train.csv) and a test dataset (test.csv), which contain information about the employees and their attrition status. Our objective is to predict the probability of positive attrition for the employees in the test dataset.

Some of the factors that could contribute to employee attrition include unhappiness about employee benefits or the pay structure, a lack of employee development opportunities, poor conditions in the workplace, and even personal reasons such as family or health issues. 
By analyzing these factors and developing an accurate prediction model, we can help companies identify and address the underlying issues that lead to employee attrition, and ultimately improve employee retention and satisfaction.

Our submissions will be evaluated based on the area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target. 
We will be using various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and AdaBoostClassifier to develop our prediction models, and we will be testing and optimizing our models using cross-validation techniques.
